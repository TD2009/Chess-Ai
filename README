Chess Bot has 2 options. 1 is when the 2 bots play each other and the other is when you can play the bot. Pretty straight forward. I'm working on making the bots play better. The code is pretty messy too, sorry about that!
Tic Tac Toe Bot has a few levels and is finished. The first move for the best bot is random just to add a little variety. From what I know, the best bot can't be beat just tied against. Have fun with it!
